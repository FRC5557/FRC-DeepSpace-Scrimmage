# Team 5557 Deep Space Scrimmage Code

## Introduction

This serves as the main code base for any code used for the 2019 Deep Space Scrimmage.
This code is at the moment very Work-In-Progress. We plan on implementing a standard arcade drive system with vision autonomous code using the Limelight and maybe motion profiling for movement during the autonomous period.

## Structure

We use WPILIB's command based programming structure. This is mainly split up into two components: Commands and Subsystems. You can read more about the two and command based programming in general [here](<[https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/c/88893](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/c/88893)>).

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue request with any questions or problems you may encounter with the code.
